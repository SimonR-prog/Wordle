# Wordle for swedish words;

## Description;
I love playing wordle. Im annoyed that you can only play it once. I also need to practice more javascript so this project will be for a dual-purpose.


#### Before starting;
What do I need;

- An array of five letter words.
- A way to display the letter.
- Some sort of comparison thing that will compare each letter in each rectangle when you press a button.
- A randomiser that will pick a random index from the array.
